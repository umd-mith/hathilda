hathilda helps you get [HathiTrust](http://www.hathitrust.org/home) metadata records as JSON-LD. The JSON-LD is not intended to be comprehesive at this time. hathilda is largely a proof of concept that's used for getting HathiTrust metadata into OpenRefine, where records can be edited, and those edits can be serialized using [OpenAnnotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/).
